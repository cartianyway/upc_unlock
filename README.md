# upc_unlock
A fine little tool for unlocking pay tv channels provided by the German UPC

# The script itself is held by us and is not meant to be published!
BUT we (me and michalspacek*) wrote a GUI interface that allows you unlocking "smartcard protected" channels 
in the Unitymedia (UPC) cable network. Their unlocking processes are really basic, thats all IÂ´m gonna say ;-)
*already known for UPC Wi-Fi Keys (Technicolor Router) "hack"...

# HOW TO

Run the exe file (make sure you are connected to the UPC cable network via WiFi / Lan), 
choose the packages you want, enter your credentials (type in real data, otherwise auth will fail)
and finally run the script by clicking start...
Now follow the instructions and wait. You will need to reset your box to factory default settings!

# Source

No source code due the reason mentioned above. Maybe we will release, maybe not...
